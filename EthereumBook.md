# What is Ethereum
# Ethereum Basics ✅
- ✅ Faucet
- ✅ Etherscan - block explorer
- ✅ Fee and gas
- ✅ Two type of accounts: Externally Owned Accounts (EOAs) and Contracts
- ✅ Wallets: MetaMask, Jaxx, MyEtherWallet and Emerald Wallet
# Ethereum Clients  ✅
- ✅ Clients: Parity (written in Rust), Geth (written in Go), cpp-ethereum (written in C++), pyethereum (written in Python), Mantis (written in Scala), Harmony (written in Java)
- ✅ Full Node, Remote client ~= wallet
- ✅ JSON-RPC Interface
- ✅ Remote client provides the ability to do one or more of the following:
  - Manage private keys and Ethereum addresses in a wallet.
  - Create, sign, and broadcast transactions.
  - Interact with smart contracts, using the data payload.
  - Browse and interact with DApps.
  - Offer links to external services such as block explorers.
  - Convert ether units and retrieve exchange rates from external sources.
  - Inject a web3 instance into the web browser as a JavaScript object.
  - Use a web3 instance provided/injected into the browser by another client.
  - Access RPC services on a local or remote Ethereum node.
- ✅ Mobiel wallets
  - Jaxx
  - Status
  - Trust Wallet
  - Cipher Browser
- ✅ Browser wallets
  - MetaMask
  - Jaxx
  - MyEtherWallet/MyCrypto
  - Mist
# Cryptography ✅
- ✅ Asymmetric cryptography: Private Keys and Public Keys
- ✅ Hash algorithm: Keccak-256, SHA-256
- ✅ Elliptic Curve Cryptography: secp256k1
- ✅ Public key (address): 0x04 - Uncompressed point - 65
- ✅ Cryptographic Hash Functions: Determinism, Verifiability, Noncorrelation, Irreversibility, Collision protection
- ✅ Where we can use hash functions: Data fingerprinting, Message integrity (error detection), Proof of work, Authentication (password hashing and key stretching), Pseudorandom number generators,  Message commitment (commit–reveal mechanisms), Unique identifiers
- ✅ Ethereum addresses: Inter Exchange Client Address Protocol, Checksum
# Wallets ✅
- ✅ Nondeterministic (Random) Wallets
- ✅ Deterministic (Seeded) Wallets
- ✅ Hierarchical Deterministic Wallets (BIP-32/BIP-44)
- ✅ Seeds and Mnemonic Codes (BIP-39
# Transactions✅
- ✅ Why do we need 'nonce'?
- ✅ Why do we need 'signature'?
- ✅ Address for burning ether - 0x000000000000000000000000000000000000dEaD
- ✅ Address for creating contract - 0x0
- ✅ Offline Signing
- ✅ Multiple-Signature (Multisig) Transactions
# Smart Contracts and Solidity
# Smart Contracts and Vyper ✅
# Smart Contracts and Security
- ✅ Security Best Practices
  - Minimalism/simplicity
  - Code reuse - DRY
  - Code quality - OpenZepplin
  - Readability/auditability
  - Test coverage
- ✅ Security Risks and Antipatterns
- ✅ Reentrancy
- ✅ Arithmetic Over/Underflows
- Unexpected Ether
- DELEGATECALL
- ✅ Default Visibilities
- ✅ Entropy Illusion
- ✅ External Contract Referencing
- ✅ Short Address/Parameter Attack (without real example)
- ✅ Unchecked CALL Return Values
- ✅ Race Conditions/Front Running
- ✅ Denial of Service (DoS)
- Block Timestamp Manipulation
- ✅ Constructors with Care (why contructor was changed)
- ✅ Uninitialized Storage Pointers
- ✅ Floating Point and Precision
- ✅ Tx.Origin Authentication
- ✅ Contract Libraries
- ✅ Conclusions
# Tokens ✅
# Oracles ✅
- ✅ The three main ways to set up an oracle can be categorized as request–response, publish-subscribe, and immediate-read.
